# Dynamic Routes — Deep & Practical

## 1️⃣ What Is a Dynamic Route?

A **dynamic route** is a route where **part of the URL is a variable**, not a fixed string.

Example:

```
/catalog/123
/catalog/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

Here:

* `/catalog` is fixed
* `123` or `uuid` is **dynamic**

---

## 2️⃣ Why Dynamic Routes Exist (Very Important)

Your backend already uses this pattern:

```
GET /CatalogItems/{id}
```

Frontend must mirror backend structure.

Dynamic routes allow:

* One component
* Many IDs
* Clean URLs
* Bookmarkable pages

---

## 3️⃣ Dynamic Route Syntax

In React Router, dynamic segments use a **colon (`:`)**

```jsx
/catalog/:id
```

This means:

> “Match `/catalog` followed by ANY value, and call it `id`”

---

## 4️⃣ Add a Dynamic Route to Your App

Open `App.jsx` and add:

```jsx
<Route path="/catalog/:id" element={<CatalogItem />} />
```

Full picture (simplified):

```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
  <Route path="/catalog" element={<Catalog />} />
  <Route path="/catalog/:id" element={<CatalogItem />} />
  <Route path="/inventory" element={<Inventory />} />
</Routes>
```

⚠️ Order doesn’t matter in React Router v6.

---

## 5️⃣ Create the Dynamic Page Component

Create:

```
src/pages/CatalogItem.jsx
```

```jsx
import { useParams } from "react-router-dom";

function CatalogItem() {
  const { id } = useParams();

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Catalog Item Details</h1>
      <p>Item ID: {id}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default CatalogItem;
```

---

## 6️⃣ What `useParams()` Really Does

`useParams()`:

* Reads the current URL
* Extracts dynamic values
* Returns them as **strings**

For:

```
/catalog/abc-123
```

```js
{ id: "abc-123" }
```

📌 Even UUIDs are strings. Conversion is your responsibility.

---

## 7️⃣ Mental Model (CRUCIAL)

Dynamic routes are just **string matching**.

```txt
/catalog/:id
↓
/catalog/anything-here
```

React Router:

* Doesn’t know what `id` means
* Doesn’t validate it
* Just passes it to you

---

## 8️⃣ How This Will Connect to Your API (Soon)

Later, this becomes:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  fetch(`/CatalogItems/${id}`)
}, [id]);
```

Route param → API param → backend

Clean and predictable.

---

## 9️⃣ Try It Yourself

Open browser and go to:

```
/catalog/test
/catalog/123
/catalog/550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000
```

Same component renders, different `id`.

---

## 10️⃣ Common Mistakes (Avoid These)

❌ Expecting params to be numbers
❌ Forgetting `useParams()`
❌ Creating multiple components for same pattern
❌ Hardcoding IDs

---

## 🔑 One-Line Summary

> **Dynamic routes let one component handle many URLs by extracting variables from the path.**
