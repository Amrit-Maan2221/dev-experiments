# `Routes` & `Route`

We already have:

* `react-router-dom` installed
* `BrowserRouter` wrapped at root

Now we answer ONE question:

> **How do we map URLs to screens (components)?**

---

## 1️⃣ What is `<Routes>`? (Mental Model First)

Think of `<Routes>` as:

> A **decision maker** that looks at the current URL and picks ONE route to render.

It:

* Reads the URL from `BrowserRouter`
* Matches it against defined routes
* Renders the best match

---

## 2️⃣ What is `<Route>`?

A `<Route>` is a **rule**:

```
If URL matches this path → render this component
```

Example in English:

> If the URL is `/catalog`, show the Catalog screen.

---

## 3️⃣ Our App’s Main Navigation (As You Defined)

We will respect your requirement:

| URL          | Screen    |
| ------------ | --------- |
| `/`          | Home      |
| `/catalog`   | Catalog   |
| `/inventory` | Inventory |

These are **top-level routes**.

---

## 4️⃣ Create Page Components (Clean Structure)

First, create a folder:

```
src/pages
```

Inside it, create:

```
Home.jsx
Catalog.jsx
Inventory.jsx
```

### `Home.jsx`

```jsx
function Home() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Play Frontend</h1>
      <p>
        This project is a React frontend for the Play Catalog and Inventory
        microservices.
      </p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Home;
```

### `Catalog.jsx`

```jsx
function Catalog() {
  return <h1>Catalog</h1>;
}

export default Catalog;
```

### `Inventory.jsx`

```jsx
function Inventory() {
  return <h1>Inventory</h1>;
}

export default Inventory;
```

👉 These are **screens**, not small components.

---

## 5️⃣ Define Routes in `App.jsx`

Open `src/App.jsx`.

### BEFORE (default)

```jsx
function App() {
  return <h1>Hello World</h1>;
}

export default App;
```

---

### AFTER — Add `Routes` & `Route`

```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import Catalog from "./pages/Catalog";
import Inventory from "./pages/Inventory";

function App() {
  return (
    <Routes>
      <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      <Route path="/catalog" element={<Catalog />} />
      <Route path="/inventory" element={<Inventory />} />
    </Routes>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 6️⃣ What Just Happened (VERY IMPORTANT)

Let’s slow this down.

### When URL is `/`

* `BrowserRouter` reads URL
* `<Routes>` checks routes
* `/` matches
* `<Home />` renders

### When URL is `/catalog`

* `<Catalog />` renders
* Home is **unmounted**

This is **component mount/unmount**, not page navigation.

---

## 7️⃣ Try It in Browser

Manually visit:

* `http://localhost:5173/`
* `http://localhost:5173/catalog`
* `http://localhost:5173/inventory`

You’ll see:

* No page reload
* URL changes
* Component swaps

🎯 That’s SPA routing in action.

---

## 8️⃣ Key Rules (Memorize These)

* `<Routes>` replaces old `<Switch>`
* Only ONE route renders at a time
* Routes depend on URL
* Routes do NOT fetch data by themselves

---

## 9️⃣ Common Beginner Mistakes (Avoided)

❌ Putting `<Routes>` inside random components
❌ Creating pages inside components folder
❌ Mixing API logic inside routing
❌ Expecting multiple routes to render together

You did it cleanly.
