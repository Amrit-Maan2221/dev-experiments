## What is Redux Toolkit (RTK)?

Redux Toolkit is the **official, recommended way** to use Redux.
It reduces boilerplate and makes Redux **easy and safe**.

## What is a Store in Redux?

The **store** is the **central place** where your app’s **global state** lives.

Think of it like:

> 🧠 **One brain for the whole React app**

---

## Store Responsibilities

The Redux **store**:

1. Holds the **entire application state**
2. Allows state to be **read**
3. Allows state to be **updated using actions**
4. Notifies UI when state changes

## Store in Redux Toolkit

In RTK, the store is created using:

```js
configureStore()
```

This replaces the old `createStore()`.

---

## Basic Store Example

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import counterReducer from './counterSlice'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer
  }
})
```

### What’s happening here?

* `configureStore` creates the store
* `reducer` is an object of **slice reducers**
* `counter` becomes a **state key**

---

## Store State Shape

If you have:

```js
reducer: {
  counter: counterReducer,
  user: userReducer
}
```

Then your state looks like:

```js
{
  counter: { value: 0 },
  user: { name: "Amritpal", isLoggedIn: true }
}
```

## Why `configureStore` is Better

RTK store gives you **out of the box**:

✅ Redux DevTools
✅ Thunk middleware (for async logic)
✅ Good defaults
✅ Less code
✅ Better error handling

No manual setup needed.

---

## Connecting Store to React

Wrap your app using `Provider`:

```js
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { store } from './store'

<Provider store={store}>
  <App />
</Provider>
```

Now **any component** can access the store.

---

## How Components Use the Store

Components **do NOT directly modify store**.

They:

* Read state using `useSelector`
* Update state using `useDispatch`

Example:

```js
const count = useSelector(state => state.counter.value)
const dispatch = useDispatch()
```

## Interview One-Line Answer

> **Redux store is a centralized state container. In Redux Toolkit, we create it using `configureStore`, which automatically sets up reducers, middleware, and DevTools with best practices.**

## Real-Life Analogy

Store = **Company database**
Reducers = **Rules to update data**
Actions = **Requests to change data**
Components = **Employees reading/updating data**
