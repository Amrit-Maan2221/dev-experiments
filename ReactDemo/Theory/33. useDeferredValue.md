### `useDeferredValue` in React

`useDeferredValue` is a hook that helps you **delay a value update** so the UI stays smooth when something expensive is happening.

It’s mainly used to **avoid UI lag** during fast typing, filtering, or heavy rendering.

---

## ✅ Syntax

```js
const deferredValue = useDeferredValue(value);
```

* `value` updates immediately
* `deferredValue` updates **after a delay**
* React keeps the UI responsive

---

## 🧠 What problem does it solve?

When you type fast in a search box and the app does heavy filtering, the UI can freeze.

Example:

```js
const [search, setSearch] = useState("");
const filtered = expensiveFilter(search);
```

If `expensiveFilter` is heavy, typing becomes slow.

---

## ✅ How `useDeferredValue` helps

```js
const [search, setSearch] = useState("");
const deferredSearch = useDeferredValue(search);

const filtered = expensiveFilter(deferredSearch);
```

✔ Typing stays smooth
✔ Filtering happens slightly later
✔ User experience improves

---

## 🔥 Real Example

```js
import { useDeferredValue, useState } from "react";

function Search() {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  const deferredQuery = useDeferredValue(query);

  const filteredList = useMemo(() => {
    return list.filter(item =>
      item.includes(deferredQuery)
    );
  }, [deferredQuery]);

  return (
    <input
      value={query}
      onChange={(e) => setQuery(e.target.value)}
      placeholder="Search..."
    />
  );
}
```

---

## 🔥 Key idea

### **Fast updates (input)**

```js
query
```

### **Slow updates (heavy work)**

```js
deferredQuery
```

## 🧠 When to use `useDeferredValue`

✅ Filtering big lists
✅ Heavy rendering
✅ Search inputs
✅ Avoiding UI lag

---

## ❌ When NOT to use it

❌ Small UI apps
❌ No heavy computation
❌ When you need instant updates
